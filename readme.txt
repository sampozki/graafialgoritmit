Code doesn't require any additional python libraries. 

I have tested the code with python 3.7.4 and 3.9.4 so atleast they should work. Most likely many older (and newer) python versions also work. 

This code WILL NOT work on python 2.7 as intended, please use python 3.x.

If you have your own tests to test the code, then you'll have to find a way by yourself :).

To test my implemention just run esim1.py file with either windows or linux:

First make sure to be in the same working directory with code files.

Windows: 
- run code with powershell either wsl: python esim1.py

Linux:
- run code with linux terminal: python esim1.py or python3 esim1.py
